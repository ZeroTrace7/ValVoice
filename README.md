## ⚙️ XTTS Playback Pipeline

- `VoiceGenerator.java` now streams XTTS audio directly from `HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofInputStream()` into JLayer `AdvancedPlayer`.
- Push-to-talk is event-driven with `java.awt.Robot`: `playbackStarted()` presses the configured key and `playbackFinished()` releases it.
- The XTTS path no longer writes temp `.mp3` files or uses JavaFX `MediaPlayer`, which removes the disk and JavaFX startup latency from live playback.
- `InbuiltVoiceSynthesizer.java` remains the fallback SAPI/audio-routing service, but VoiceGenerator now owns the active PTT lifecycle.
