# ValVoice

Minimal README restored during documentation cleanup.

Overview:
- Java app with XMPP bridge to provide voice/chat integration for Valorant.
- Key entry points: `run_valvoice.bat`, `START_WITH_FIX.bat`, and Maven build via `pom.xml`.

Quick start (Windows):
1) Double-click `START_WITH_FIX.bat` or `run_valvoice.bat`.
2) If building from source: install JDK 17+, then run `setup_maven.bat` and build with Maven.

Notes:
- This README was reconstructed after removing many Markdown documents. If you want the original detailed README back, let me know and Iâ€™ll restore or expand this.
- Kept reference docs: `VALORANT_AUDIO_SETUP.md`, `VB_AUDIO_SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `VERIFICATION_STATUS.md`.
