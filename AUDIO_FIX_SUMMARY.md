# Audio Routing Fix Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

### The Issue
Your logs showed that the audio routing was working, but **you couldn't hear game audio** because the old implementation was routing **ALL audio** (including Valorant) to VB-Cable, which made you lose sound from your headphones/speakers.

### The Solution
I've fixed the audio routing to **ONLY route PowerShell TTS** to VB-Cable, while keeping your **game audio completely normal** in your headphones/speakers.

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. **AudioRouter.java** - Complete Rewrite
- **Removed**: System-wide audio default changing
- **Removed**: Audio restoration on shutdown (not needed anymore)
- **Added**: App-specific routing for `powershell.exe` only
- **Result**: Only TTS goes to VB-Cable, everything else stays normal!

### 2. **ValVoiceController.java** - Updated
- Fixed compilation error (lambda expression with final Process variable)
- Updated status messages to reflect TTS-only routing
- Removed references to system audio restoration

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Audio Flow:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ValVoice App                                           │
│  ├─ Game Audio (Valorant) → Your Headphones 🔊        │
│  ├─ Music/Videos → Your Headphones 🔊                  │
│  └─ TTS (PowerShell) → VB-Cable → Valorant Mic 🎙️    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Happens:
1. You type a chat message in Valorant
2. Press ENTER
3. **TTS automatically speaks** through PowerShell
4. PowerShell audio → **routed to VB-Cable Input**
5. VB-Cable Output → **Valorant microphone input**
6. Teammates hear the TTS! 🎉

### What You Hear:
- ✅ Game sounds (footsteps, gunshots, etc.)
- ✅ Teammate voice chat
- ✅ Music playing in background
- ✅ Everything EXCEPT the TTS (which goes to your teammates)

## 🎮 Valorant Setup (One-Time)

### Audio Settings in Valorant:
1. **Press ESC** → Settings → **AUDIO** tab
2. **Voice Chat** section:
   - **INPUT DEVICE**: `CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`
   - **VOICE ACTIVATION**: `Open Mic` (NOT Push to Talk!)
   - **OUTPUT DEVICE**: Your normal headphones/speakers

### Why Open Mic?
With Open Mic enabled, Valorant continuously listens to the VB-Cable Output. When TTS speaks, it automatically goes to your teammates - **no need to press V or any other key!**

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required:
1. ✅ **VB-Audio Virtual Cable** installed
   - Download: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
   - Install and restart computer
   
2. ✅ **AudioDeviceCmdlets** PowerShell module (auto-installed by ValVoice)
   - Already installed from your logs ✓

### Optional (but recommended):
- **SoundVolumeView.exe** in ValVoice folder
  - Download: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/soundvolumeview.zip
  - Extract `SoundVolumeView.exe` to project folder
  - Provides more reliable app-specific routing

## 🚀 Testing Your Fix

### Build Command:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\HP\IdeaProjects\ValVoice
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

### Run Command:
```cmd
java -jar target\valvoice-1.0.0.jar
```

### Expected Logs:
```
✓ VB-Audio Virtual Cable detected and ready.
✓ TTS audio routed to VB-CABLE - game audio unchanged
✓ Audio successfully routed to VB-CABLE Input (TTS only)
```

## 🎯 Automatic TTS Workflow

### ✅ NEW WAY (Automatic - No Key Pressing!):
1. Type message in Valorant chat
2. Press **ENTER**
3. **TTS speaks automatically**
4. **Teammates hear it via Open Mic!** ← AUTOMATIC!

### ❌ OLD WAY (Manual - NOT USED):
1. Type message
2. Press ENTER
3. TTS speaks
4. **You** press V (push-to-talk) ← Manual, unreliable!

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you can't hear game audio:
1. Check Windows Sound Settings
2. Make sure **System Default Playback Device** is your headphones
3. ValVoice should NOT change this anymore

### If teammates can't hear TTS:
1. Verify Valorant Input Device: `CABLE Output`
2. Verify Valorant Voice Activation: `Open Mic`
3. Check logs for "Audio successfully routed to VB-CABLE"

### Manual Setup (if automatic fails):
1. Open **Windows Sound Settings**
2. Click **App volume and device preferences**
3. Find **PowerShell** in the list
4. Set Output to: **CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)**
