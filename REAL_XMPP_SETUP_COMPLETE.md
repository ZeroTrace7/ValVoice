# âœ… Real Riot XMPP Client - Setup Complete (v2.0)

## What Was Done - **IMPROVED VERSION**

The XMPP bridge has been **upgraded with the production-grade Valorant XMPP Watcher implementation** for maximum reliability and compatibility.

### Major Improvements (v2.0):

1. **âœ… Professional Authentication Flow**
   - Uses **PAS (Player Authentication Service) token** 
   - Proper **XMPP SASL authentication** (X-Riot-RSO-PAS mechanism)
   - **6-stage authentication handshake** matching Riot's official client
   - Fetches **entitlements token** for full authorization

2. **âœ… Dynamic Server Selection**
   - Fetches **affinity from PAS token** (your optimal server region)
   - Gets **server list from Riot's client config API**
   - Automatically connects to the **correct regional XMPP server**
   - No hardcoded servers - always up-to-date

3. **âœ… Enhanced Reliability**
   - **Proper TLS socket handling** (not @xmpp/client library)
   - **150-second keepalive** (matches official client)
   - **Automatic reconnection** on disconnect
   - **Roster and chat history requests** on connect

4. **âœ… Based on Open-Source Reference**
   - Implementation derived from [techchrism/valorant-xmpp-watcher](https://github.com/techchrism/valorant-xmpp-watcher)
   - Proven to work with real Valorant servers
   - Battle-tested authentication flow

## How It Works (Detailed)

### Authentication Flow (6 Stages):
1. **Local Riot Client API**: Reads lockfile â†’ Gets accessToken + PUUID
2. **PAS Token**: Fetches from `riot-geo.pas.si.riotgames.com` â†’ Contains server affinity
3. **Entitlements**: Fetches from `entitlements.auth.riotgames.com` â†’ Authorization token
4. **Riot Config**: Gets XMPP server list from `clientconfig.rpg.riotgames.com`
5. **Parse Affinity**: Decodes PAS token JWT â†’ Determines your optimal server (e.g., "na2", "eu1")
6. **XMPP Connect**: Connects to affinity-based server with SASL authentication

### XMPP Authentication Stages:
```
Stage 1: Open stream          â†’ Server responds with available auth mechanisms
Stage 2: SASL auth            â†’ Send PAS token + RSO token
Stage 3: Restart stream       â†’ Authenticate successful, restart stream
Stage 4: Bind resource        â†’ Get your JID (e.g., <puuid>@na2.pvp.net/RC-valvoice)
Stage 5: Establish session    â†’ Create XMPP session
Stage 6: Send entitlements    â†’ Authorize with entitlements token
```

### Server Affinity Example:
Your PAS token might say: `"affinity": "na2"`
â†’ Config says: `"chat.affinities.na2": "na2-riot-chat-1.chat.si.riotgames.com"`
â†’ Connects to: `na2-riot-chat-1.chat.si.riotgames.com:5223`

## Key Differences from v1.0:

| Feature | v1.0 (Old) | v2.0 (New) |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **XMPP Library** | @xmpp/client | Native Node.js TLS |
| **Auth Method** | Simple password | PAS token + SASL |
| **Server Selection** | Hardcoded region map | Dynamic affinity-based |
| **Entitlements** | Not used | Fetched and sent |
| **Keepalive** | 30 seconds | 150 seconds (official) |
| **Reconnection** | Basic retry | Automatic with cleanup |

## How to Test

### Step 1: Start Valorant/Riot Client
The bridge **requires** the Riot Client to be running.

### Step 2: Run ValVoice
```bash
cd C:\Users\HP\IdeaProjects\ValVoice
run_valvoice.bat
```

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
You should see:
```json
{"type":"startup","version":"2.0.0-real"}
{"type":"info","message":"Getting authentication credentials..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Fetching PAS token..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Fetching entitlements..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Affinity: na2"}
{"type":"info","message":"Fetching Riot config..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Connecting to XMPP server: na2-riot-chat-1.chat.si.riotgames.com"}
{"type":"info","message":"Connected to XMPP server, authenticating..."}
{"type":"info","message":"XMPP auth stage 2..."}
{"type":"info","message":"XMPP auth stage 3..."}
{"type":"info","message":"XMPP auth stage 4..."}
{"type":"info","message":"XMPP auth stage 5..."}
{"type":"info","message":"XMPP auth stage 6..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Connected to Riot XMPP server"}
{"type":"info","message":"Requesting roster and chats..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Sending presence..."}
```

And in stderr (console):
```
âœ… Connected to Riot XMPP server
```

### Step 4: Test in Game
1. Start a Valorant match
2. Send messages in **team/all/party chat**
3. **ValVoice should read them aloud via TTS** âœ…

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch PAS token"
**Cause**: Riot Client not fully loaded or API unreachable

**Solution**:
1. Make sure Riot Client is **fully logged in**
2. Wait 10 seconds after Riot Client starts
3. Check your internet connection

### "Affinity not found in Riot config"
**Cause**: PAS token contains unsupported region

**Solution**:
1. This is rare - means Riot added a new region
2. Try restarting Riot Client
3. Report the affinity value for investigation

### "XMPP auth stage X failed"
**Cause**: Authentication handshake interrupted

**Solution**:
1. Check firewall isn't blocking port 5223
2. Ensure no VPN is interfering
3. Bridge will auto-retry in 10 seconds

### Messages not being read aloud
**Cause**: Bridge connected but Java app not processing

**Solution**:
1. Check ValVoice status bar shows "XMPP: Ready"
2. Verify TTS engine is working (test manually)
3. Check console for "incoming" JSON events
4. Ensure you're sending messages in a **Valorant match** (not just lobby)

## Technical Details

### APIs Used:
```
âœ… Local Riot Client:     https://127.0.0.1:<port>/chat/v1/session
âœ… PAS Service:           https://riot-geo.pas.si.riotgames.com/pas/v1/service/chat
