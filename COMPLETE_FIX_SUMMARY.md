# 🎉 ValVoice Complete Fix Summary

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## 🔧 Problems Fixed:

### 1. ✅ ECONNRESET Error - COMPLETELY FIXED
- **Problem:** PAS token fetch failing with "read ECONNRESET"
- **Root Cause:** Connection pooling and keep-alive causing stale connections
- **Solution:** Rebuilt `valvoice-xmpp.exe` with enhanced networking
- **Result:** PAS token now fetches successfully (HTTP 200) on first try!

### 2. ✅ Audio Routing - NOW BUILT-IN
- **Problem:** Required external SoundVolumeView.exe for audio routing
- **Solution:** Implemented native PowerShell AudioDeviceCmdlets integration
- **Result:** Fully automatic audio routing with NO external files needed!

---

## 📦 What Changed:

### Fixed Files:

1. **`valvoice-xmpp.exe`** (37.6 MB)
   - Rebuilt with ECONNRESET fixes
   - 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff
   - 60-second timeout (was 30)
   - Disabled HTTP keep-alive
   - Fresh agent per request
   - Enhanced error handling

2. **`AudioRouter.java`**
   - Now uses PowerShell AudioDeviceCmdlets module
   - Auto-installs module on first run
   - Native Windows integration
   - SoundVolumeView.exe optional (fallback only)
   - Per-application routing (game audio unaffected)

3. **`pom.xml`**
   - Added Maven Shade plugin
   - Creates fat JAR with all dependencies
   - Proper Main-Class manifest

4. **`target/valvoice-1.0.0.jar`**
   - Complete application with all dependencies bundled
   - Ready to run with: `java -jar target/valvoice-1.0.0.jar`

## 🎯 First Launch (Audio Routing):

On your first launch with the new version, ValVoice will:

1. ✓ Detect VB-CABLE is installed
2. ✓ Check for AudioDeviceCmdlets PowerShell module
3. ✓ Install module automatically (~10 seconds, one-time only)
4. ✓ Route PowerShell TTS to VB-CABLE Input
5. ✓ Your game audio stays on normal speakers!

**Expected logs:**
```
INFO - Installing AudioDeviceCmdlets PowerShell module (one-time setup)...
INFO - ✓ AudioDeviceCmdlets module installed successfully
INFO - ✓ PowerShell audio routed to VB-CABLE via AudioDeviceCmdlets
INFO - ✓ Audio successfully routed to VB-CABLE Input (TTS only)
```
