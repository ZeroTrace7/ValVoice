## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure Valorant Audio

Launch Valorant and configure these settings:

**Settings ‚Üí Audio ‚Üí Voice Chat:**
- **Voice Chat:** ENABLED ‚úÖ
- **Input Device:** **CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)** ‚≠ê
- **Output Device:** Your normal headphones/speakers
- **Voice Activation:** **OPEN MIC** (NOT Push to Talk!) ‚≠ê
- **Voice Activation Sensitivity:** LOW (slider far left ~10-20%)
- **Incoming Voice Volume:** 80-100%
- **Party Voice Volume:** 100%
- **Team Voice Volume:** 100%
- **Loopback Test:** Turn OFF (you don't want to hear yourself)

**‚ùó Critical Settings:**
- ‚úÖ **Input Device = CABLE Output** (NOT "CABLE Input" - this is the most common mistake!)
- ‚úÖ **Voice Activation = OPEN MIC** (Push to Talk won't work with automatic TTS)

---

## üéÆ Step 3: How It Works

```
1. You type message in Valorant chat ‚Üí Press ENTER
   ‚Üì
2. ValVoice detects message via XMPP bridge
   ‚Üì
3. TTS engine speaks text ‚Üí Audio routes to VB-CABLE Input
   ‚Üì
4. VB-CABLE Output (acts as virtual microphone) ‚Üí Valorant picks it up
   ‚Üì
5. Teammates hear TTS through in-game voice chat! üé§
```

**What ValVoice Does Automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Detects VB-Cable installation on startup
- ‚úÖ Routes TTS audio ONLY to VB-Cable (your normal audio stays normal)
- ‚úÖ Saves your original audio device settings
- ‚úÖ Restores original settings when you close the app
- ‚úÖ You continue to hear game audio, music, Discord normally!

**What You Hear vs. What Teammates Hear:**
- **You:** Game sounds, music, Discord (normal)
- **Teammates:** TTS voice through Valorant voice chat
- **Note:** You won't hear your own TTS unless you enable loopback

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will this get me banned from Valorant?**
A: No. ValVoice uses Riot's official local API (same as the Valorant client). It doesn't modify game files or inject code. It's purely a chat-to-voice tool.

**Q: Can teammates mute my TTS?**
A: Yes, they can mute you just like any other player (ESC ‚Üí Social ‚Üí Mute).

**Q: Does this work in all game modes?**
A: Yes - works in Competitive, Unrated, Spike Rush, Deathmatch, Custom games.

**Q: Can I use this in other games?**
A: Currently ValVoice only supports Valorant. Other games would need similar API access.

**Q: Why do I need Open Mic instead of Push to Talk?**
A: TTS needs to speak automatically when you type. Push to Talk requires manual key press, which defeats the automation purpose.

**Q: Can I customize the TTS voice?**
A: Yes! Settings tab ‚Üí Voice dropdown ‚Üí Select any installed Windows TTS voice. You can also install additional voices from Microsoft Store.

**Q: How much bandwidth does this use?**
A: Minimal. ValVoice only monitors local Valorant chat (no external servers). TTS is generated locally on your PC.
