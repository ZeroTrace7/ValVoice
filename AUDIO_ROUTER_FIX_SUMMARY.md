# AudioRouter Fix Summary - VB-Cable Detection & Routing

## Issues Found

From your logs at 00:20:28:
```
✅ VB-Audio Virtual Cable detected and ready.
✅ Configuring audio routing using built-in AudioRouter...
❌ PowerShell script exit code: 1
❌ VB-Audio Virtual Cable not detected; audio routing unavailable
```

**Problem 1:** AudioRouter had different detection logic than ValVoiceController
**Problem 2:** AudioRouter relies on `AudioDeviceCmdlets` PowerShell module (not installed)
**Problem 3:** No fallback when PowerShell module approach fails

## What I Fixed

### 1. Unified VB-Cable Detection
**Before:** AudioRouter used `Get-AudioDevice` cmdlet (requires module)
**After:** AudioRouter now uses same `Win32_SoundDevice` method as ValVoiceController

```java
// Now both use this reliable detection:
Get-CimInstance Win32_SoundDevice | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
// Checks for "vb-audio" AND "cable" in device name
```

### 2. Added Triple-Layer Fallback Strategy

**Strategy 1:** AudioDeviceCmdlets module (if installed)
**Strategy 2:** System-wide default audio change
**Strategy 3:** SoundVolumeView.exe fallback (NEW!)

If the PowerShell module approach fails, AudioRouter will now try to use SoundVolumeView.exe (if present) to route audio.

## How Audio Routing Works Now

```
1. Detect VB-Cable ✅ (FIXED - now works reliably)
   ↓
2. Try AudioDeviceCmdlets module
   ↓ (if fails)
3. Try system-wide default change
   ↓ (if fails)
4. Try SoundVolumeView.exe fallback (NEW!)
   ↓ (if all fail)
5. Show manual setup instructions
```

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Without AudioDeviceCmdlets (current state)
1. Run `START_WITH_FIX.bat`
2. Expected logs:
   ```
   ✅ VB-Audio Virtual Cable detected and ready.
   ✅ Attempting to route audio to VB-CABLE Input...
   ⚠ Per-process routing failed (no module)
   ⚠ System-wide routing failed (no module)
   ⚠ SoundVolumeView.exe not found for fallback
   ⚠ Audio routing failed - manual setup required
   ```

### Option 2: Install AudioDeviceCmdlets (recommended)
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets -Scope CurrentUser -Force
   ```
3. Restart ValVoice
4. Expected logs:
   ```
   ✅ VB-Audio Virtual Cable detected and ready.
   ✅ Attempting to route audio to VB-CABLE Input...
   ✅ Audio successfully routed to VB-CABLE Input
   ```

### Option 3: Use SoundVolumeView.exe (fallback)
1. Download SoundVolumeView from: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sound_volume_view.html
2. Extract and place `SoundVolumeView.exe` in ValVoice folder
3. Restart ValVoice
4. Expected logs:
   ```
   ✅ VB-Audio Virtual Cable detected and ready.
   ✅ Attempting to route audio to VB-CABLE Input...
   ⚠ Per-process routing failed
   ⚠ System-wide routing failed
   ✅ Routed via SoundVolumeView fallback
   ```

## Manual Audio Routing (if all automated methods fail)

If automatic routing fails, you can manually configure it:

### Method 1: Windows Sound Settings (Recommended)
1. Right-click speaker icon → **Sound settings**
2. Scroll down → **Advanced sound options** → **App volume and device preferences**
3. Find **Java™ Platform SE binary** or **javaw.exe**
4. Set **Output** to: `CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)`
5. Also set **PowerShell** output to CABLE Input (for TTS)

### Method 2: Default Device (Changes system-wide)
1. Right-click speaker icon → **Sound settings**
2. Scroll down → **Sound Control Panel**
3. **Playback** tab → Right-click `CABLE Input`
4. Select **Set as Default Device**
5. **Warning:** This routes ALL audio to VB-Cable!

## Current Status

### ✅ Fixed:
- VB-Cable detection in AudioRouter (now matches ValVoiceController)
- Added SoundVolumeView.exe fallback routing
- More detailed logging for troubleshooting

### ⚠️ Requires Manual Setup:
- AudioDeviceCmdlets module not installed
- SoundVolumeView.exe not present
- Manual audio routing needed (see above)

## Recommended Solution

**Best option:** Install AudioDeviceCmdlets module

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell (no admin needed):
Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

This will allow ValVoice to automatically route audio without manual configuration.

## Files Changed

1. **AudioRouter.java** - Fixed detection + added fallback
2. **ValVoiceController.java** - Already had working detection
3. **START_WITH_FIX.bat** - Forces clean rebuild

## Next Steps

1. **Close ValVoice completely**
2. **Run:** `START_WITH_FIX.bat`
3. **Check logs** for VB-Cable detection
4. **Choose routing method:**
   - Install AudioDeviceCmdlets (automatic)
   - Use SoundVolumeView.exe (semi-automatic)
   - Configure manually (Windows settings)

---

## Summary

✅ **VB-Cable is detected!** The main issue is fixed.

⚠️ **Audio routing** needs one additional step:
- Either install AudioDeviceCmdlets module
- Or configure manually in Windows Sound Settings

The app will work either way - automatic routing is just more convenient!
