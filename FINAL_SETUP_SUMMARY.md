## 🚀 **How to Use:**

### **Step 1: Start Riot Client**
Make sure Valorant or Riot Client is running and fully logged in.

### **Step 2: Launch ValVoice**
```bash
cd C:\Users\HP\IdeaProjects\ValVoice
run_valvoice.bat
```

### **Step 3: Verify Connection**
Check the console output for these messages:
```json
{"type":"startup","version":"2.0.0-real"}
{"type":"info","message":"Getting authentication credentials..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Fetching PAS token..."}
{"type":"info","message":"Affinity: jp1"}
{"type":"info","message":"Connecting to XMPP server: ..."}

✅ Connected to Riot XMPP server
```

### **Step 4: Test in Game**
1. Join a Valorant match (Unrated, Competitive, or Deathmatch)
2. Type a message in **team chat** or **party chat**
3. **ValVoice will read it aloud via TTS!** 🎉

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Authentication Flow:**
```
1. Read Riot lockfile
   ↓
2. Fetch access token from local Riot Client API
   ↓
3. Fetch PAS token from riot-geo.pas.si.riotgames.com
   ↓
4. Fetch entitlements token
   ↓
5. Get Riot client config (XMPP server list)
   ↓
6. Parse affinity from PAS token (e.g., "jp1" for Japan)
   ↓
7. Connect to regional XMPP server via TLS (port 5223)
   ↓
8. 6-stage XMPP SASL authentication
   ↓
9. ✅ Start receiving real-time chat messages
```

### **Message Flow:**
```
Valorant Game Chat
        ↓
Riot XMPP Server (jp1-riot-chat-...)
        ↓
valvoice-xmpp.exe (XMPP Bridge)
        ↓
JSON output to stdout
        ↓
Main.java (ValVoice Java app)
        ↓
ChatListenerService processes messages
        ↓
TtsEngine speaks the text
        ↓
🔊 Audio output to speakers/VB-Cable
```

- ✅ **Channels**: Party chat and Team chat enabled
- ✅ **Whispers**: Enabled

You can change these in the **Settings panel** within ValVoice.

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting:**

### **No audio when typing in chat:**

**Check 1: Is XMPP connected?**
Look for this in console logs:
```
✅ Connected to Riot XMPP server
```
If missing, restart ValVoice with Riot Client running.

**Check 2: Are you in a match?**
- XMPP only sends match chat, not lobby chat
- Join a Deathmatch or Unrated to test

**Check 3: Is the message being received?**
Look for `[XmppBridge:incoming]` logs in console
If you see them, XMPP is working - issue is with TTS

**Check 4: Test TTS manually**
Type something in ValVoice's text input and click Speak
If this works, XMPP-to-TTS pipeline may have an issue

### **"MODULE_NOT_FOUND" error:**
✅ **FIXED** - This was resolved by fixing the index.js file

### **"Could not authenticate with Riot Client":**
- Ensure Riot Client is running and logged in
- Wait 10 seconds after Riot Client starts
- Check that lockfile exists at:
  `C:\Users\HP\AppData\Local\Riot Games\Riot Client\Config\lockfile`

## 📊 **Testing Checklist:**

Run through this checklist to confirm everything works:

- [x] ValVoice starts without errors
- [x] XMPP bridge starts (external-exe mode)
- [x] Console shows "Connected to Riot XMPP server"
- [x] Riot Client details detected (jp1 region)
- [ ] Join a Valorant match
- [ ] Type "test" in team chat
- [ ] **Hear TTS say "test"** ← **THIS IS THE FINAL TEST!**

---

## 💡 **Important Notes:**

1. **VB-Cable Warning**: You saw this warning:
   ```
   VB-Audio Virtual Cable devices missing or incomplete
   ```
   This means audio won't route to your Valorant mic. To fix this:
   - Download VB-Audio Virtual Cable from: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
   - Install it
   - Restart ValVoice
   
   **However**, for testing purposes, you can hear TTS through your regular speakers!

2. **Affinity: jp1**: Your region is correctly detected as Japan (jp1)
   - XMPP server will be: `jp1-riot-chat-1.chat.si.riotgames.com`
   - All authentication is region-specific and automatic

3. **No Java changes needed**: The existing ValVoice Java code already supports the XMPP protocol we implemented!
