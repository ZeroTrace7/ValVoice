# ValVoice Setup Checklist

## Pre-Launch Verification

### âœ… 1. VB-Audio Virtual Cable
- [ ] Downloaded from https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
- [ ] Installed successfully
- [ ] **Rebooted Windows** (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Verify in Windows Sound Settings:
  - Playback device: `CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)` exists
  - Recording device: `CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)` exists

### âœ… 2. Audio Routing (AUTOMATIC - No Action Required!)
**Good news:** ValVoice now has built-in audio routing! You don't need to download any external tools.

- âœ¨ Audio routing happens automatically when you start the app
- ðŸ”§ The app will detect VB-CABLE and configure everything for you
- âš¡ Just install VB-CABLE (step 1 above) and you're done!

**Old Method (No Longer Needed):**
~~SoundVolumeView.exe~~ - This external tool is **no longer required**. The app now handles audio routing internally using PowerShell and Windows APIs.

### âœ… 3. XMPP Bridge Executable

### âœ… 6. Verify Status Bar (in ValVoice UI)
- [ ] **XMPP**: Should show "Ready" (green)
- [ ] **Bridge Mode**: Should show "external-exe"
- [ ] **VB-Cable**: Should show "Detected"
- [ ] **Audio Routing**: Should show "Active (built-in)" or "Active (SoundVolumeView)" (green)
- [ ] **Self**: Should show your player ID (after joining a game)

#### No Sound in Valorant
- **Cause**: Audio not routed to VB-CABLE
- **Fix**: 
  - The app should route audio automatically on startup
  - Check status bar: "Audio Routing" should be green
  - If still not working, manually route in Windows: 
    - Sound Settings â†’ App volume â†’ PowerShell â†’ Output: CABLE Input
    - OR Sound Settings â†’ App volume â†’ Java â†’ Output: CABLE Input
